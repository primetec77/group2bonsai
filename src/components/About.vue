                    Bonsai World was founded 2023, inspired by the power that nature can bring. We truly believe that living without a connection between nature and soul cannot fulfill, and that a life constricted by impatience is not a life that satisfies. Instead one must take the time to live and embrace the unexpected journey fate has to offer. Life is simple. We complicate a lot. You learn the essence of life by paying attention to the simple things that surround you. We aim to convey this thought and bring people closer to themselves and nature through the art of Bonsai.

                    We are very proud to partner with JOSTUM reforestation projects to create a better world. This unique organization works directly with the villages and communities that suffer from extreme poverty due to deforestation and destruction of the land that sustains them. Eden employs thousands of local villagers and provides them with all the training and tools necessary to plant millions of trees each year and grow them to maturity.
                    Currently, Eden plants approximately 15 million trees per month. We make a small contribution by planting a tree with every Bonsai sold. On the whole, this is a very tiny part. But we believe that every little bit helps to create a better world.
